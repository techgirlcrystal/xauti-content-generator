# White Label Setup Guide for $199 Clients

## Complete Multi-Tenant System Overview

Your Xauti Content Generator now includes a complete white label system where each $199 client gets their own isolated environment with:

- **Their own n8n workflows** (no shared resources)
- **Their own Stripe accounts** (no shared payments)
- **Their own OpenAI API keys** (no shared costs)
- **Custom branding** (logo, colors, company name)
- **Custom domains** (clientname.yourdomain.com)
- **Data isolation** (completely separate user bases)

## How It Works

### 1. Tenant Creation Process
When a client pays $199 for white label access:

1. **Access Admin Panel**: Go to `/admin` in your master application
2. **Create New Tenant**: Fill in client details:
   - Client name and company information
   - Domain and subdomain setup
   - Custom branding (colors, logo)
   - Their n8n webhook URL
   - Their Stripe API keys
   - Their OpenAI API key

3. **Automatic Environment Setup**: The system creates an isolated tenant environment

### 2. Client Environment Features

Each client gets:
- **Isolated Database**: All their users and data are completely separate
- **Custom Branding**: Logo, colors, and company name throughout the interface
- **Own API Integrations**: Their Stripe processes their payments, their n8n handles workflows
- **Subdomain Access**: clientname.yourdomain.com routes to their branded instance

### 3. Technical Architecture

```
Master Domain (yourdomain.com)
├── Admin Panel (/admin)
├── Your main application
└── Tenant Subdomains
    ├── client1.yourdomain.com (Client 1's branded app)
    ├── client2.yourdomain.com (Client 2's branded app)
    └── client3.yourdomain.com (Client 3's branded app)
```

## Setting Up a New $199 Client

- [ ] Custom domain (if they want their own)
- [ ] Logo URL and brand colors
- [ ] Their n8n instance webhook URL
- [ ] Their Stripe API keys (secret and public)
- [ ] Their OpenAI API key

### Step 2: Create Tenant via Admin Panel
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your application
2. Click "Create New Client" tab
3. Fill in all client information
4. Configure their API integrations
5. Set custom branding options
6. Click "Create White Label Client"

### Step 3: DNS Configuration
For custom domains, help client set up:
```
CNAME clientname.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 4: Client Onboarding
Send client:
- Their unique access URL: `https://clientname.yourdomain.com`
- Login instructions for their branded platform
- Documentation for their users
