# Domain Setup Guide for White Label Clients

## Overview
As a $199 white label client, you can use your own custom domain for your branded content generation platform. This gives you complete professional control over your client-facing URL.

## Domain Options

### Option 1: Use Your Existing Domain (Recommended)
Point a subdomain of your existing domain to your white label platform:
- `app.yourbusiness.com`
- `content.yourbusiness.com` 
- `tools.yourbusiness.com`

### Option 2: Purchase New Domain
Buy a dedicated domain for your content platform:
- `yourbusinesstools.com`
- `yourcompanyai.com`

## DNS Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Access Your Domain Provider
Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)

### Step 2: Add CNAME Record
Create a new DNS record with these settings:

**For Subdomain (Option 1):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: app (or content, tools, etc.)
Value: [your-subdomain].xautiplatform.com
TTL: 300 (5 minutes)
```

**For Root Domain (Option 2):**
```
Type: A Record
Name: @ (root)
Value: [IP Address provided by Xauti]
TTL: 300
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
After setting up DNS:
1. Wait 5-15 minutes for propagation
2. Test your domain: `https://app.yourbusiness.com`
3. You should see your branded content platform

## SSL Certificate
SSL certificates are automatically provisioned for your custom domain within 24 hours of DNS configuration. Your site will show as secure with the green lock icon.

## What Your Clients See

### Before Custom Domain:
`https://yourclient.xautiplatform.com`
